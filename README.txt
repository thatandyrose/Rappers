# Rappers
Rappers was created in order to fufill the following requirements:
1. A place to keep common .NET helpers, extension etc that I could use across projects.
2. A place to keep very simple abstractions over more complex libraries in order to allow me to implement functionality quickly in multiple applications.

# Current Rappers
## Rappers.Baseline
This is a very simple "common" library. So far I'm using it mostly for extensions.

## Rappers.DaData
The aim here is to abstract data access. So far it only has a Mongo implementation, but others could (and will) be written.

# State of Rappers
Rapper is very much in Alpha stage and I believe is pretty much for personal use. Any questions or comments are welcome, github message me.

thanks!
